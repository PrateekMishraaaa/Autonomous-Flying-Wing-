# Autonomous Flying Wing

What Are Flying Wings? 
Flying wings are a type of aircraft design that integrates the fuselage and wing into a single cohesive structure. This design eliminates the need for separate tail and fuselage components, making the aircraft more aerodynamically efficient. The entire airframe contributes to lift generation, leading to a unique blend of efficiency and performance.

Advantages
1.	Aerodynamic Efficiency: The seamless design reduces drag significantly, enhancing fuel efficiency and range.
2.	Structural Efficiency: Fewer components mean a lighter overall structure, which can contribute to better payload capacity relative to the aircraft's weight.
3.	Stealth Characteristics: The reduced radar cross-section of flying wings makes them advantageous for military applications.

Drawbacks

1.	Stability Challenges: The absence of a tail can lead to stability issues, particularly in pitch and yaw.
2.	Limited Space: The unique shape may limit internal volume for passengers or cargo.
3.	Design Complexity: Achieving a balanced design that incorporates stability, control, and efficiency is more complex than traditional configurations.

Airfoil Selection

•	Main Wing Airfoil: The MH49 airfoil is selected for the main wing. This airfoil is known for its excellent performance in terms of lift-to-drag ratio across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, making it particularly suited for use in efficient, long-range flying wing designs. Its characteristics support efficient cruise performance as well as good handling at lower speeds.

•	Fuselage Airfoil: For the integrated fuselage section, the NACA 0012 airfoil is chosen. Given that flying wings blend the wing and fuselage into a single body, the NACA 0012 provides a robust, symmetrical profile that contributes to stability and helps manage the airflow over the body, especially at varying angles of attack.
